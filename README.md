# Math namespace object. Calculation of the area of a circle.

- Get the user to enter the radius of the circle.
- Check that the user has not canceled the entry or left the field blank.
- Convert the entered string into a floating-point numeric value.
- Check if the entered value is a number.
- If the data is correct, then we calculate the area of the circle using the formula (πr²): π * radius^2.
- Output the result to the console with rounding to two decimal places.
